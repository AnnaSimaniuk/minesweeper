# Minesweeper Game - JavaScript

The Minesweeper game is a fun and challenging puzzle game. Players must use logic and deduction to reveal cells on the grid without hitting any mines. If a player uncovers a mine, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed based on the number of correct guesses.

For convenience, the project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://annasimaniuk.github.io/minesweeper/).
